I am pleased to present a self-developed project aimed at the comprehensive analysis of HTTP response headers with a particular focus on the assessment of security headers. This endeavor involves a meticulous evaluation of various security headers, including but not limited to Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) content headers, X-Frame-Options headers, and numerous others. The project delivers its findings in an aesthetically pleasing and easily digestible format. The underlying script has been meticulously crafted using the Python programming language, leveraging APIs for data retrieval and employing web scraping techniques facilitated by the Beautiful Soup library. This amalgamation of tools and methodologies ensures a thorough and insightful examination of HTTP response headers with the ultimate goal of enhancing web security.
